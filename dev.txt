DEV NOTES ========================================================

CURRENT TASKS:
* make highScores hold top 3 scores (instead of just one)
responsive design (should work down to mobile, do after all JS is done)


FUTURE FEATURE IDEAS
* timer component, fast completion could give player a score bonus
* a way to upgrade the current high score functionality to include the last 3 highest scores 
* upgrade game end so that the page doesn't have to refresh
